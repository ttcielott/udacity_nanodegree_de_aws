# How to Fix the Error of 'Generate DDL' in Athena

Even before creating from s3 bucket, we can see already-created customer_landing table which is created from GlueTable step.

However, that table lacks following setting.

Solution 1. You can go back to Glue Table and find 'advanced properties' and manually add these four 'SerDe' properties.

Solution 2. Or you can create a new table in Athena following the steps in the course.

I would recommend the first choice because you should add table schema all over again in the second solution.
